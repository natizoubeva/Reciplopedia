French fries

images\Fries.jpg
* vegetable oil 100.0 ML
* salt 3.0 TSP
* potatoes 1000.0 GRAMS
Begin by peeling the potatoes and rinsing them under cold water to remove any excess starch. Pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.
Cut the potatoes into evenly-sized sticks or strips. You can adjust the thickness based on your preference, but aim for roughly 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) in thickness.
Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl and cover them with cold water. Allow them to soak for about 30 minutes. This step helps remove some of the starch, resulting in crispier fries.
While the potatoes are soaking, heat vegetable oil in a deep pot or deep fryer. You'll need enough oil to completely submerge the fries. The oil should be heated to around 325°F (165°C).
Once the potatoes have finished soaking, drain them well and pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.
Carefully add a batch of the dried potato sticks to the hot oil. Be cautious to avoid overcrowding the pot, as this can lead to soggy fries. Fry them in batches if necessary.
Cook the fries in the hot oil for about 5-7 minutes or until they are light golden brown. Use a slotted spoon or a spider strainer to remove the fries from the oil and transfer them to a 
paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet.
Increase the temperature of the oil to 375°F (190°C). Once the oil is hot, return the partially cooked fries to the oil in batches. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes or until 
the fries turn golden brown and crispy.Once cooked to your desired level of crispiness, remove the fries from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate or baking sheet.
Immediately season them with salt while they are still hot.

In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and melted butter. Mix well until the crumbs are evenly coated.
Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch (23cm) springform pan, creating an even crust. Use the back of a spoon or the bottom of a glass to press the crumbs firmly 
into the pan.In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and vanilla extract, and continue to beat until well combined.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to ensure all the ingredients are fully incorporated.
Pour the cream cheese mixture over the crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula or the back of a spoon.

Once baked, turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake in the oven with the door slightly ajar for about 1 hour. This gradual cooling helps prevent cracks.
Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature. Once cooled, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to
allow it to set. When ready to serve, carefully remove the sides of the springform pan. Transfer the cheesecake to a serving platter.

* butter 45.0 GRAMS
* milk 240.0 ML
* eggs 4.0 PIECES
* cheddar 120.0 GRAMS
* flour 30.0 GRAMS
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place a baking sheet in the oven to preheat as well.
Butter the insides of four individual ramekins generously. Dust the ramekins with grated cheese, shaking off any excess. This will help the souffl? rise and cling to the sides.
In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the flour and whisk continuously for about 1 minute to create a smooth paste, known as a roux.
Gradually pour in the milk while whisking continuously, ensuring no lumps form. Cook the mixture for a few minutes until it thickens to a smooth and creamy consistency, resembling 
a white sauce or b?chamel. Remove the saucepan from the heat and add the grated cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted and fully incorporated into the sauce. Season with salt and 
pepper to taste.In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks lightly. Gradually pour the beaten egg yolks into the cheese sauce, whisking continuously until well combined.
In another bowl, using an electric mixer or a whisk, beat the egg whites until they reach stiff peaks. If desired, add a pinch of cream of tartar to stabilize the egg whites and 
help them hold their shape. Gently fold about a third of the beaten egg whites into the cheese sauce mixture to lighten it. Then, carefully fold in the remaining egg whites, being 
cautious not to overmix and deflate the mixture. Divide the souffl? mixture evenly among the prepared ramekins, filling them almost to the top.
Place the ramekins on the preheated baking sheet in the oven. Bake for approximately 15-20 minutes or until the souffl?s are puffed up, golden brown on top, and still slightly jiggly 
in the center. Once baked, remove the souffl?s from the oven and serve immediately. They will begin to deflate quickly, so enjoy them promptly.

* apple 7.0 PIECES
* lemon juice 1.0 TBSP
* flour 330.0 GRAMS
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and granulated sugar for the crust. Add the cold cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour 
mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the ice water, starting with 1/4 cup, and mix gently with a fork until the dough comes together. Add more water, a tablespoon 
at a time, if needed. Be careful not to overmix the dough. Divide the dough in half and shape each portion into a disk. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at 
least 30 minutes. In another mixing bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and lemon juice for the filling. Toss gently until the apples are 
coated with the mixture. Roll out one chilled dough disk on a lightly floured surface to fit a 9-inch (23cm) pie dish. Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to the pie dish, gently 
pressing it into the bottom and sides. Pour the apple filling into the pie dish, making sure it is evenly distributed. Dot the top of the filling with the small pieces of butter.
Roll out the second chilled dough disk to create the top crust. You can leave it as a full round shape, or cut it into strips for a lattice design. Place the rolled-out crust over 
the apple filling, or create a lattice pattern by weaving the strips of dough over the filling. Trim any excess dough from the edges and crimp them to seal the pie. You can use a fork or 
your fingers to create a decorative edge. Optional: Brush the top crust with an egg wash made by whisking together one beaten egg and a tablespoon of milk or cream. This will give the crust a golden color.
Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
Once baked, remove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 1-2 hours before serving. This allows the filling to set.

In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
In a large skillet or saucepan, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is 
softened and translucent. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir well to combine. 
Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
In a medium bowl, combine the shredded mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.
To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping them. 
Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by another layer of the meat sauce. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing 
with a layer of meat sauce on top.Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional
15 minutes or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly, and the cheese on top is golden brown.
Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.
Serve the lasagna hot and enjoy!
